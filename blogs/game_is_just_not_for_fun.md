## Game is just not for fun

The gaming industry has evolved significantly over the years, transforming from a niche market to a multi-billion dollar business. As an investor, it's essential to understand the overview of the game industry, its rise, and the dominant platforms to make informed decisions.

### What is the overview of game industries

The game industry encompasses dozens of job disciplines and thousands of jobs worldwide, influencing the technological advancement of personal computers and consistently growing since at least 2015 (Nasdaq, 2023). The traditional value chain of the game industry includes game development, publishing, distribution, retailers, consumers, and hardware platform manufacturers (Wikipedia, 2023). The industry employs various professionals, including game programmers, designers, level designers, game producers, game artists, and game testers (Medium, 2023).

### When is the rise in game business

The gaming industry has seen a significant rise in recent years, with global revenue generated by the gaming industry being greater than the global revenue generated by the music and movie industries combined (Forbes, 2023). The industry has grown from $184.4 billion in 2022, with the global recorded music industry generating $26.2 billion and the global movie industry generating $26 billion in box office revenue (Statista, 2023). The rise of digital marketing and digital media platforms, such as Twitch, YouTube, and Facebook Gaming, has driven the industry's growth, allowing gamers to broadcast their gameplay, engage with their fans in real-time, and create communities (World Economic Forum, 2022).

### Which game platform is dominated

According to recent statistics, PC is the most dominant platform, with 66% of developers targeting PC for their current projects, followed by PS5 at 35% (PC Gamer, 2023). The global video game market is expected to continue growing, with the mobile gaming market generating an estimated 98.7 billion U.S. dollars of the total revenue (Statista, 2023).

## Who are customers of the game

Understanding the customers of the game industry is crucial for investors. The industry caters to a diverse range of gamers, with various preferences and interests.

### How many types of games do people play

There are numerous types of games that people play, including classic board games, arcade games, action games, shooters, and role-playing games, among others (Mainleaf, 2023). The article "Exploring the 7 main types of games: concepts and examples" provides a broader overview of different game genres, including massively multiplayer online games (MMOs), sports-based fighting, and casino games (Mainleaf, 2023).

### What's the main type of game that people play

While it's challenging to pinpoint a single main type of game that people play, MMOs and action-adventure games are popular options that offer social interaction and community building (Statista, 2023). Shooter games and action-adventure games are the two most popular game genres across different age groups, according to a recent survey (Statista, 2023).

In conclusion, the gaming industry offers a lucrative investment opportunity, with a growing market, diverse customer base, and various platforms to explore. As an investor, it's essential to stay informed about the industry's trends, dominant platforms, and customer preferences to make informed decisions.
