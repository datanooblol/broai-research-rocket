## Tax, the truth, the ugly and the mandatory

As a crucial aspect of our financial lives, taxes can be complex and overwhelming, but understanding the basics is essential to make informed decisions about our finances. In this article, we will break down the concept of tax, its types, and how it works, as well as explore the similarities between tax and death, the types of taxes working people must know, and how to leverage tax strategies to our advantage.

### What is tax for dummies

Tax is a compulsory contribution to the government, levied by the government to pay for public goods and services that benefit society as a whole [1]. Taxes are used to fund various government activities, such as infrastructure development, education, healthcare, defense, and social welfare programs. According to the article "Taxes 101" on Dummies.com, taxes can be a complex and overwhelming topic, but it's essential to understand the basics to make informed decisions about our finances [1].

There are several types of taxes, including income tax, sales tax, property tax, and payroll tax [1]. Income tax is a tax on an individual's income, including salary, wages, and investments. Sales tax is a tax on goods and services sold, typically collected by retailers. Property tax is a tax on real estate, such as homes and commercial properties. Payroll tax is a tax on employee earnings, used to fund social security and other government programs.

Tax calculation involves several steps, including calculating gross income, deductions, taxable income, tax rate, and tax liability [1]. Gross income is the total income, including salary, wages, and investments. Deductions are eligible expenses, such as charitable donations, medical expenses, and mortgage interest, that can be subtracted from gross income. Taxable income is the income after deductions, and tax rate is the percentage of taxable income paid as tax. Tax liability is the amount of tax owed.

### Why tax and death look similar

The phrase "death and taxes" is often used to describe two things that are considered inevitable or certain in life [2]. According to Wikipedia, the phrase "death and taxes" is an idiom that refers to the two things that are certain in life [2]. The similarity between tax and death is likely due to the fact that both words have a sense of finality or irreversibility to them. Death is, of course, the ultimate end of life, while taxes are a financial burden that people must pay, often with no way to avoid or escape them.

### What types of tax working people must know

Working people must know several types of taxes, including income taxes, payroll taxes, sales taxes, property taxes, capital gains taxes, and gross receipts taxes [3]. Income taxes are taxes on the income earned by individuals, including salaries, wages, tips, and investments. Payroll taxes are taxes paid by employers and employees to fund Social Security and part of the Medicare program. Sales taxes are taxes on retail products based on a set percentage of the retail price. Property taxes are taxes paid on property such as real estate, boats, automobiles, and recreational vehicles. Capital gains taxes are taxes on the profit made from selling an asset, such as stocks, bonds, or real estate. Gross receipts taxes are taxes applied to a company's gross sales, regardless of profitability and without deductions for business expenses.
