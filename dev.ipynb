      "\n",
      "For decades, estimates of annual insurance fraud costs may have been too low, lacking updates for inflation and other essential data components. A 2022 study by The Coalition Against Insurance Fraud (CAIF) indicates that insurance fraud can cost U.S. consumers $308.6 billion yearly. That amount includes estimates of annual fraud costs across several liability areas, including Life Insurance ($74.7 billion), Property and Casualty ($45 billion), Workers Compensation ($34 billion), and Auto Theft ($7.4 billion).\n",
      "\n",
      "Auto insurance fraud\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Auto insurers lose at least $29 billion a year, according to a 2017 study by Verisk, to premium leakage, the \"omitted or misstated underwriting information that leads to inaccurate rates.\" Several types of information failures and fraudulent practices drive costs up, such as unrecognized drivers ($10.3 billion), underestimated mileage ($5.4 billion), violations/accidents ($3.4 billion), and false garaging to lower premiums ($2.9 billion). While not always a result of malicious or conscious actions, premium leakage creates problems for consumers, too—as much as 14 percent of all personal auto premiums can be attributed to the cost of covering premium leakage.\n",
      "\n",
      "No-fault auto insurance is a system that lets policyholders recover financial losses from their own insurance company, regardless of who was at fault in a motor vehicle accident. However, in many no-fault states, unscrupulous medical providers, attorneys, and others pad costs associated with legitimate claims – for example, by billing an insurer for a medical procedure never performed.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Salvage fraud\n",

      "Another common auto fraud involves vehicles damaged by storm flooding that later appear in used car lots and auction sales.

      "\n",
      "Standardized state rules for titling vehicles are necessary to combat salvage fraud. In recent years, some states in hurricane-prone parts of the United States have adopted rules requiring the words \"flood vehicle\" on the titles of vehicles that have been water damaged and rebuilt. Before such a vehicle can be sold, the buyer must be notified in writing of the vehicle's past flood damage. However, if a state in the region does not have such strict laws, it can become a dumping ground for undeclared flooded vehicles.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the hurricane season of 2005, the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB) created a database that stores vehicle identification numbers (VINs) and boat hull identification numbers (HINs) from flooded vehicles and boats. This information is available to law enforcers, state fraud bureaus, insurers, and state motor vehicle departments. The general public can access VINCheck®, an online lookup service, to determine if a vehicle may have been reported as a \"salvage.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Another attempt to solve the problem of title washing is the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System (NMVTIS), a database that requires junk and salvage yard operators and insurance companies to file monthly reports on vehicles declared total losses. The program operates under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Justice and is administered by the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators. By 2019, this system included information on 99 percent of the U.S. vehicle population (based on 2019 Federal Highway Administration data), and 49 states were reporting data to the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another form of salvage fraud can involve counterfeit parts, such as airbags. Industry observers say counterfeit airbags are produced for nearly every vehicle model. Unscrupulous auto body repair shops use these less expensive airbags and obtain reimbursement from insurance companies for legitimate airbags.\n",

      "Healthcare fraud\n",

      "\n",
      "Although healthcare insurance is generally outside the purview of property/casualty insurance, healthcare fraud affects all types of property/casualty insurance coverage that include a medical care component, such as medical payments for auto accident victims or workers injured in the workplace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fraud and abuse take place at many points in the healthcare system. Doctors, hospitals, nursing homes, diagnostic facilities, medical equipment suppliers, and attorneys have been cited in scams to defraud the system.
