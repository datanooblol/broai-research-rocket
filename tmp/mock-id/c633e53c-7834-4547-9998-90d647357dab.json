Ancient Egypt were the supreme rulers of the land, similar to today\u2019s kings and queens. They were both the religious and political leaders of the country and were often thought of as one of the gods. Because of this, their duties included making sure the people were safe and the country made a profit.  \n  \n  \nLots of pharaohs did this by making war and conquering nearby cultures to take their wealth and make sure they couldn\u2019t attack them. Other pharaohs took a more peaceful approach and established friendships as well as trade with other countries.  \n  \n  \n  \nRead on to learn 10 facts about pharaohs to share with your children and some lovely resources we think they\u2019ll enjoy.\n\nTagged topics: Facts For Kids\n\n\n\n1\\. The word \u2018pharaoh\u2019 comes from a Greek word meaning \u2018great home\u2019. It was originally used to describe the kingdom, but eventually became the name of Ancient Egypt\u2019s ruler.\n\n2\\. As soon as a pharaoh came into power it was expected they would begin building their burial tomb. Their tombs were magnificent buildings that took a very long time to construct. It was believed that anything within the tomb would help them live well in the afterlife, so they filled them with as much gold and treasures as they could. They were built in the shape of a pyramid and the largest one ever built is still standing today!\n\nTake a look through this illustrated PowerPoint to learn more about the amazing pyramids of Egypt, and then let your child construct their very own using this craft activity.\n\n![Image 19: 3D Ancient Egyptian Pyramid](https://www.twinkl.com.sg/resource/t-t-24261-new-3d-ancient-egyptian-pyramid)\n\n\n\n3D Ancient Egyptian Pyramid\n===========================\n\n\n\n3\\. The very first pharaoh is believed to be Narmer. He united Upper and Lower Egypt as one country and founded the first capital city, Memphis. He reigned for a massive 62 years and is said to have been killed by a hippopotamus!\n\nThis PowerPoint is a great way to take an in-depth look at some of the greatest pharaohs, when they ruled and what they accomplished.\n\n4\\. Historians divide up the timeline of Ancient Egypt history by the dynasties of the pharaohs. A dynasty is when one family remained in power by passing it down through the generations. In the 3000 years of Ancient Egypt history, it is believed there were 31 dynasties.\n\n5\\. The crown of a pharaoh had the image of the cobra goddess, Wadjit. Only the pharaoh was allowed to wear anything with her image as she was meant to protect them from their enemies by spitting flames at them.\n\n6\\. Symbolism was very important to Ancient Egyptians, and they carved well-wishes onto their pharaoh\u2019s tombs. These were called \u2018cartouche\u2019 and were in the shape of an oval ring said to symbolise a rope around the universe. Inside the cartouche would be the name of their pharaoh in hieroglyphs - the form of writing created by Ancient Egyptians that is still studied today.\n\n\n\nSee if your children can crack the code on these Hieroglyph Worksheets and learn the symbols for the gods and goddesses of Ancient Egypt.\n\n7\\. Tutankhamun is often called King Tut. He became pharaoh when he was only nine years old. He is very well-known today because most of his tomb stayed intact. In 1922, British archaeologists Howard Carter and Lord Carnarvon discovered fabulous treasures inside his tomb including his golden death mask. This discovery renewed people\u2019s interest in Ancient Egypt, and the treasures have travelled all over the world to places like France, Japan and Canada for people to see.\n\nIntroduce Tutankhamun to your children using this fantastic fact sheet all about the treasures found in his tomb. Let the creativity flow and allow them to design their very own Egyptian mask using this colouring activity - they\u2019ll look brilliant on your display walls all about Ancient Egypt.\n\n![Image 21: Ancient Egyptians: The Tomb of Tutankhamun Fact File](https://www.twinkl.com.sg/resource/t2-h-4490-the-ancient-egyptians-tutankhamuns-tomb-information-print-out)\n\n\n\nThe Ancient Egyptians Tutankhamun's Tomb Facts Sheet\n====================================================\n\n\n\n8\\. When a pharaoh died, before they were put to rest in their tomb, their body was mummified. They believed this preserved the body ready for the afterlife and the whole process took up to 70 days. Their pharaoh\u2019s body was cleaned, and some of their organs were removed. They were placed in special jars believed to be protected by the four sons of the Egyptian God Horus. After this, the body was wrapped in linen (creating the familiar Halloween costume we know today) and they were ready for their journey into the afterlife.\n\n\n\nThis information sheet lists all the different steps Ancient Egyptians took to ensure their souls lived on after their body had died. See how much your child can remember and ask them to have a go wrapping a doll using this activity sheet for tips!\n\n![Image 23: Mummification instructions worksheet for KS2 - Primary Resources](https://www.twinkl.com.sg/resource/t2-h-021-egyptians-mummification-instructions)\n\n\n\nMummification Instructions Activity\n===================================\n\n\n\n9\\. Only men were supposed to have the title of pharaoh, but some women did take the position for themselves. This was sometimes to step in as \u2018regent\u2019 to help a child ruler who needed guidance when making important decisions.\n\nThe very first woman to give herself the title of the pharaoh was Hapshetsut. She even began wearing a fake beard to make people accept her as ruler. She was the longest-reigning female pharaoh and was loved for creating trade deals with other countries and making Egypt a richer nation.\n\n10\\. Interestingly the person considered to be the last pharaoh of Ancient Egypt was also a woman. Cleopatra VII had a tumultuous reign. She was 18 when her father died and handed the power of Egypt down to her, instead of her 10-year-old brother.\n\nAs her brother got older he decided he was a better fit for the role of a pharaoh, and so forced Cleopatra out. After this, she became friends with the Romans, Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, who helped her fight her brother\u2019s army and win back her title.\n\nDiscover what made Cleopatra so powerful and well-respected with this colourful PowerPoint.\n\nWe hope you enjoyed learning these 10 facts about pharaohs and have fun sharing them with your child!\n=====================================================================================================\n\nTagged topics: Facts For Kids\n\n\n\n#### Twinkl Ireland\n\nWe help those who teach.
