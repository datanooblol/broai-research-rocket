Ninja employed deception and forgery tactics to take opponents out by surprise. Due to their unorthodox methods, which contradicted the way of the warrior (bushido), the ninja were not credited with the same honor as the samurai.\n\nSponsored Ninja Experiences - sponsored listings\n\tSAMURAI NINJA MUSEUM TOKYO\nTokyo Samurai Ninja Museum offers the best ninja experiences. Ninja training, ninja show, ninja blow gun, ninja stars and ninja lessons. Service hours: 09:30 ~ 18:30\n\nThe diverse range of skills practiced by the ninja is called ninjutsu - the art of stealth - and includes training in armed combat, weapon techniques, military strategy, meteorology, geometry and breathing synthesis. Ninjutsu was passed down through generations within families or directly from teacher to a selected one or few disciples. This secrecy in part explains why little factual information exists about the ninja, giving rise to lots of stereotyping of them both within and outside of Japan.\n\nVarious types of throwing stars\nHistory\n\nAs early as the 11th century, the inhabitants of Iga and Koka gained a reputation for their skills in unconventional warfare. Close to the political center Kyoto, yet distinctly remote due to their rugged terrains, Iga and Koka presented an ideal hideout location for refugees, bandits and losing parties of battles. Many ninja families lived here within autonomously governed communities, developing their martial skills for self defense.\n\nDuring the age of the warring states in the 15th and 16th centuries, many warlords would hire the ninja of Iga and Koka as mercenaries for their set of unique skills in facilitating the conquest of castles and victories in battles. These were the heydays of the ninja.\n\nOnce peace was established in the 17th century, the ninja were mainly employed by the Tokugawa Shogunate to spy on the various regional lords and to guard Edo Castle. During these times, the ninja became greatly romanticized in popular culture, such as kabuki, which led to inaccuracies in the common perception of them. The stereotypes were subsequently exported to the West and further developed to entertain audiences there.\n\nKoka Ninja Village\nWhere to appreciate the ninja today\n\nThe best places to appreciate the ninja today are Iga and Koka, the traditional heartlands of the ninja, and Togakushi in Nagano, home of the Togakure school of ninja. These respective regions offer some actual buildings used by the ninja in the past and/or museums which house previously used tools and weapons, thus retaining some level of authenticity.\n\nOther ninja attractions include those found at theme parks and tend to be less authentic. Ninja scenarios are recreated and ninja shows are staged according to popular conceptions for entertainment. Ninja mansions are a feature at many of them. They are houses built with trapdoors and secret passages, forming mazes which visitors have to find their way through.\n\nIga Ueno\nIga Ninja Museum\u2022\nThe small but well done Iga Ninja Museum consists of a ninja residence with revolving walls, trap doors and hidden compartments, exhibition halls displaying ninja tools, gadgets and weapons, and a demonstration zone with spectacular shows featuring ninja skills and real weapons.\nKoka\nKoka Ninja Village\nThe Koka Ninja Village is remote, rural and run-down. Attractions include a house with secret doors and hidden compartments, a simple museum displaying various tools utilized by the Koka Ninja, a secret tunnel under a well and a throwing star throwing range.\nKoka\nKoka Ninja House\nThis 300 year old mansion used to be resided in by ninja and appears like an ordinary house from the outside; inside however, it is equipped with many ingenious traps and devices. Visitors are allowed to explore the house and discover its various trapdoors and secret passages.\nNagano\nTogakure Ninpo Museum\u2022\nThis museum showcases tools and weapons used by the ninja of the Togakure school as well as many interesting photographs of them practicing various techniques in warfare and infiltration. There is also a very entertaining ninja mansion with a labyrinth of many secret doors, passages and contraptions. Closed in winter.\nNagano\nKids Ninja Village\nLocated in the same area as the Togakure Ninpo Museum, this small theme park features ninja mansions, obstacle courses and jungle gyms. The idea is to have fun whilst pretending to be a ninja undergoing training. The park targets children, but some of its attraction are also fun for adults. Closed in winter.\nKanazawa\nNinjadera (Ninja Temple)\nThis temple earned its nickname because of its many deceptive defenses, aimed at guarding against possible intruders or attack. Guided tours in Japanese are conducted to introduce its hidden tunnels, secret rooms, traps, and labyrinth of corridors and staircases.\nKinugawa Onsen\nNikko Edomura (Edo Wonderland)\nNikko Edomura (Edo Wonderland) is a history-based theme park recreating Japanese town life during the Edo Period. Ninja-related attractions include a maze, the Ninja House of Illusion and live ninja performances on stage.\nKyoto\nToei Uzumasa Eigamura\u2022\nFilm set and theme park in one, the Eigamura features a collection of replicas of traditional Japanese buildings. Ninja-related attractions include a ninja mansion featuring a labyrinth, ninja shows and a throwing star (shuriken) throwing range. It is also possible to dress up and get photographed in more than 30 attires including samurai, geisha and ninja attires.\nNinja Restaurant\nA few ninja-themed restaurants and cafes can be found in Japan. They typically come with waiters and waitresses dressed as ninja and dishes presented in ninja-related ways. The most famous \"Ninja Tokyo\" restaurant is located a short walk from Tokyo Station.\nTours and activities\n\nSeveral travel companies offer tour packages and activities that allow participants to put on a samurai armor or ninja costume, learn about the various weapons and techniques, and in some cases take part in a mock battle.\n\nSponsored Ninja Experiences - sponsored listings\n\tSAMURAI NINJA MUSEUM TOKYO\nTokyo Samurai Ninja Museum offers the best ninja experiences.
