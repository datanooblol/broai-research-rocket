Their air of mystery helped them infiltrate contemporary popular culture.\n\nJK Jeanhee Kim\n\n\n\nHistory/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\n\nPublished: November 10, 2023\n\nLast Updated: March 06, 2025\n\nPrint\n\nCopy\n\nThe silent, black-clad ninja who spies, sabotages and assassinates\u2014without leaving a trace\u2014remains a popular Japanese character in modern books and films. It has loosely inspired pop-culture phenomena ranging from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to the American Ninja Warrior. But facts about ninja history can be just as elusive as the iconic fighters themselves.\n\n**Ninja History Is Shrouded by Mythology**\n------------------------------------------\n\nSome modern scholars question whether ninjas actually existed\u2014or were merely a mythic invention. That skepticism stems, in part, from ninjas often being described as martial arts experts with supernatural abilities, or as sorcerers who can conjure fire at their fingertips and move wind and objects with hand signals. In many stories, they fly and even split themselves into multiple bodies to foil those in hot pursuit.\n\nMost scholars believe that historical accounts of ninjas, like those of many underworld characters, were wildly embellished, while retaining a grain of truth. \u201cThe usual approach, even among scholars, is simply to accept the original ninja myth as a genuine historical phenomenon that has for centuries been greatly romanticized and, more recently, highly commercialized,\u201d writes Stephen Turnbull, a Japanese history expert and author of _Ninja: Unmasking the Myth_.\n\nNinjas were active from the 14th century, when they were hired by daimyo, or feudal Japanese warlords, chiefly for intelligence and counterintelligence. But their intrinsically secretive nature left few mentions of them in the historical record. Much of what\u2019s known comes from texts written in the 1600s and later, well after the shogun wars, when ninjas flourished.\n\n### Samurai and Bushido\n\nThe Samurai were fearsome warriors whose traditions of honor and discipline live on in the study of jujitsu and kendo today.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Ninjas** Served Mostly as Spies\n---------------------------------\n\nWhat distinguished a ninja? Unlike Japan\u2019s other famous warriors, the samurai, who were highly trained fighters from elite families, ninjas came from all levels of society. And unlike samurai, ninjas weren\u2019t bound by a strict code of honor (bushido) that required face-to-face fighting. Warlords could employ ninjas to engage in the kind of guerrilla warfare that would dishonor a samurai.\n\nSince they served as mercenaries and spies, ninjas needed to be especially adept at disguise and subterfuge. And while popularly depicted as trained assassins, they were more likely to marshal skills of stealth, distraction and counterintelligence than to kill. Their ultimate responsibility was to covertly gather useful intelligence for their lord.\n\nThe word \u201cninja\u201d doesn\u2019t appear in historical texts and testimonials before the 19th century. Rather, early texts referred to these fighters most commonly as \u201cshinobi,\u201d which shares a common character with ninja in Japanese kanji (writing). The Vocabulario da Lingoa de Iapam, a Japanese-Portuguese dictionary published by the Jesuit mission in Nagasaki in 1603, defines shinobi as \u201ca spy who in times of war enters a castle by night or clandestinely, or infiltrates the enemy ranks to obtain intelligence.\u201d\n\nThat intelligence made shinobi exceedingly valuable to their patrons, says historian Yamada Y\u00fcji, vice president of the International Ninja Research Center at Japan\u2019s Mie University and editor of a multidisciplinary anthology of ninja studies: \u201cYou need to know the topography of the enemy\u2019s position, the condition of his food supplies, the structure of his castle. It was the job of the shinobi to obtain this kind of crucial information. They would infiltrate the enemy domain and ascertain the lay of the land\u2026and create chaos through acts of sabotage and arson.\u201d\n\n**Origins of the Ninja Arts**\n-----------------------------\n\nAs mercenaries, ninja fought for warlords all over Japan. But according to the Gunpo Samurai Youshuu, a dictionary of samurai martial law, the best feudal-era shinobi came from the neighboring provinces of Iga and Koka, situated in the mountain region southeast of Japan\u2019s then-capital, Kyoto. By the 14th century, about two dozen ninja schools had popped up throughout Japan. According to the 17th-century Bansenshukai, a 22-volume encyclopedia on the art of the ninja, the ninjutsu discipline found inspiration in the guerrilla tactics of the brilliant Chinese war strategist, Sun Tzu.\n\nThe Bansenshukai describes the ninja arts as social skills, conversation techniques, mnemonics (memory aids), transmission techniques, medicine, astronomy and even sorcery. Ninjas were trained to use their intellect and vast knowledge to infiltrate any social setting, gain knowledge and escape safely to report their findings to their patron. Psychologically, a good ninja required intense self-discipline and purity of mind, says Y\u00fcji: \u201ca mental state of absolute tranquility, in which a person will not flinch even if a bare blade is pressed against his chest.\u201d\n\nAs masters of disguise, ninjas would often infiltrate their target not under cover of night, but in broad daylight, disguised as a merchant or a Buddhist priest. They used many common tools, such as the sickle and sword, as weapons so they could blend in with peasants and farmers. But they also famously carried shuriken, the ninja star, because these pocket-sized, hand-held throwing blades could be easily hidden and used to disarm an opponent.\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\n---------------------\n\n\n\nAsian History\n\n### Inside the Japanese Tradition of Cherry Blossom Viewing\n\nMuch more than just picnics under pretty pink trees, the national pastime of hanami is deeply entwined with the country\u2019s national identity, spiritual beliefs and artistic traditions.\n\n\n\nThe best bladed weapon-makers in the country go head-to-head.\n\n\n\n7-DAY FREE TRIAL\n\nCommercial-free,\n\nCancel anytime\n\nStream Now\n\nExclusions & terms apply\n\n**Defining Moments in Ninja History**\n-------------------------------------\n\nWhile their origins may reach back as far as the 12th century or before, shinobi were active when Japan was rife with territorial skirmishes between warlords. Shinobi played important roles in the Nanbokucho Wars (1336\u20131392) and the Warring States Period (1467-1568), among others.\n\nThe Honno-ji Incident of 1582 shows how ninjas could even influence the course of Japanese history. After a samurai general assassinated Oda Nobunaga, one of three powerful shoguns who sought to unify Japan, at the Honno-ji Temple in Kyoto, he then set about to kill Nobunaga\u2019s loyalists and allies. But his target, Tokugawa Ieyasu, another of Japan\u2019s \u201cgreat unifiers, \u201dwas lucky to have as a friend and general the ninja Hattori Hanzo of Iga. A master swordsman, Hanzo (or possibly another, anonymous ninja) is believed to have smuggled Ieyasu out of enemy territory and brought him safely home.\n\nHad Ieyasu been killed, Japanese history might have veered in a substantially different direction. In 1603, the emperor G\u014d-Yozei elevated him to be a shogun. Ieyasu\u2019s Tokugawa shogunate, the last in the shogun era, is credited with ushering in two centuries of peace and prosperity known as the Edo period.\n\nThe transition to peace was messy, however, and marred by enormous wealth inequality. One ninja, Iga-born Ishikawa Goemon, is said to have attempted to make life more bearable for the peasants by using ninjutsu to steal gold from the rich and give it away to the needy. For some, Goemon represents a ninja gone rogue. Authorities such as the Japan Ninja Council, however, consider him a legendary outlaw hero likely to have sprung from someone\u2019s imagination, and not a real historical figure.\n\nWhether real or fictional, Goemon\u2019s story ends tragically. After he failed in his attempt to assassinate Toyotomi Hideyoshi, a powerful warlord, Hideyoshi\u2019s men executed Goemon by boiling him alive. In depictions on many silkscreens and woodcuts, Goemon\u2019s young son was also thrown into the tub, and the father heroically holds him above the boiling oil, saving his son\u2019s life as he himself dies.\n\n**Pop Culture Resurgence**\n--------------------------\n\n\n\nPerformers in \u201cNinja Turtles\u201d costumes attend screening of Paramount Pictures\u2019 \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\u201d at Paramount Pictures Studios on July 29, 2023, in Los Angeles, California.\n\nPhillip Faraone/Getty Images for Paramount Pictures\n\n\n\nPerformers in \u201cNinja Turtles\u201d costumes attend screening of Paramount Pictures\u2019 \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\u201d at Paramount Pictures Studios on July 29, 2023, in Los Angeles, California.\n\nPhillip Faraone/Getty Images for Paramount Pictures\n\nWith such colorful stories, it\u2019s not surprising that ninjas became such pop culture icons for Japan. A mayor of Iga, Okuse Heishichir\u014d, played a large role in bringing ninjas to broader public consciousness in the 1950s by building the Ninjutsu Wonder Museum. A flood of books, articles and pulp fiction followed.\n\nA key popularizing moment came with the ninja scene in the 1967 James Bond film _You Only Live Twice_. Just as hundreds of ninja assassins abseiled, commando-style, from a shattered skylight into SPECTRE\u2019s lair, throwing shuriken, the myth of the ninja had broken through and infiltrated mainstream pop culture. By the 1980s, ninjas had exploded into a huge business, appearing widely in movies, TV, video games, toys, comics and even product naming\u2014from blenders to motorbikes to perfume. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles became a hit animated series, and its related toys became some of the best-selling action figures of all time. It\u2019s the kind of widespread fame and attention that, ironically, the shinobi actively shunned.\n\n\n\nChronicling the untold stories that gave rise to the modern toy industry.\n\n\n\nStream NowView Details\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n\n----------------------\n\n\n\nAsian History\n\n### The Brutal History of Japan\u2019s \u2018Comfort Women\u2019\n\nBetween 1932 and 1945, Japan forced women from Korea, China and other occupied countries to become military sex slaves.\n\n\n\nAsian History\n\n### Inside the Japanese Tradition of Cherry Blossom Viewing\n\nMuch more than just picnics under pretty pink trees, the national pastime of hanami is deeply entwined with the country\u2019s national identity, spiritual beliefs and artistic traditions.\n\n\n\nAsian History\n\n### How Japan Took Control of Korea\n\nBetween 1910 and 1945, Japan worked to wipe out Korean culture, language and history.\n\n\n\nAsian History\n\n### What Is Seppuku?\n\nThe ritual suicide originated in Japan's ancient warrior class.\n\nSee All Articles\n\nAbout the author\n\n\n\n\n----------------------\n\nJK\n\nJeanhee Kim\n\nJeanhee Kim is an editor and writer in New York City.\n\nFact Check\n\n\n\n\n----------------\n\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.
