The word _ninja_ derives from the Japanese characters _nin_ and _ja_. _Nin_ initially meant \"persevere,\" but over time it developed the extended meanings \"conceal\" and \"move stealthily.\" In Japanese, _ja_ is the combining form of _sha_, meaning \"person.\" Ninjas originated in the mountains of ancient Japan as practitioners of ninjutsu, a martial art sometimes called \"the art of stealth\" or \"the art of invisibility.\" They often served as military spies and were trained in disguise, concealment, geography, meteorology, medicine, and also the arts of combat and self-defense we associate with modern martial arts. Popular legends still identify them with espionage and assassinations, but modern ninjas are most likely to study ninjutsu to improve their physical fitness and self-defense skills.\n\nExamples of _ninja_ in a Sentence\n---------------------------------\n\nRecent Examples on the Web\n\nExamples are automatically compiled from online sources to show current usage.
